# IaaS environment files

## Folders

- ```fpush``` contains the files / folder you may want to push on the IaaS with the command ```ia fpush``` or ```ia cfpush```
- ```ssh``` keys installed on the IaaS instance. Use them to connect to your instance on the IaaS with your putty if needed *(not used directly by the current project)*
- ```terraform``` for the tool used to manage remote docker host creation and more *(see [terraform documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/))*
