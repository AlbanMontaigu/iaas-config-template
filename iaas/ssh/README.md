# SSH keys for remote ssh connection on the docker host

- ```insecure-key``` private key
- ```insecure-key.pub``` public key
- ```insecure-key.ppk``` related key for putty

**This keys are insecure** because they are shared by all users of this template. This is an easy way provided to connect to the remote docker host but you have to find something better if you want a more secure connection.
